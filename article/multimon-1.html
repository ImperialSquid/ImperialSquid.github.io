<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>A friend recently suggested it would be a fun challenge to see if you could build a neural network to identify Pokémon types using just their sprites. Given I was in the process of trying to get my head around neural networks and learning PyTorch at the time, this seemed like a fun little exercise to ease me into it! These posts will tell the story of how I got on. They’ll ideally bridge the gap between being comprehendible and having just enough of the gory details for those more interested in that side. If you want the technical stuff, you can find the GitHub repo of my results <a title="https://github.com/ImperialSquid/Multimon" href="https://github.com/ImperialSquid/Multimon">here</a>. Without further ado, let’s begin!</p>
<h1 id="why-is-the-project-called-multimon">Why is the Project called “Multimon”?</h1>
<p>So, first of all, why that name for the project? Since, at the time of writing, I am doing a PhD on Multitasking Neural Networks (i.e. a neural net where we have more than one output), I decided to expand on the original pitch by my friend to include a few more things. As opposed to just the type I wanted to get:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s Type (such as Flying, Grass, etc)</li>
<li>The Generation it’s from (pokémon games are released in generations, the intuition here being that the design principles may have changed over time)</li>
<li>Whether or not it’s a “Shiny” (shiny pokémon is the term given to a rarer form of each pokémon, they are identical in all regards except that they have a different colout palette)</li>
</ul>
<p>So for example, with the Lucario sprite shown to the right, we want to guess Fighting and Steel for the types, Gen IV for the generation and False for the shininess!</p>
<h1 id="the-data">The Data</h1>
<p>The most important thing now, therefore, is to get some data to work on! I landed on using the Pokébase library for python (<a title="https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokebase" href="https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokebase">GitHub here</a>), which acts as a lightweight interface for the PokéAPI database.</p>
<p>So for each sprite, I also need to store the correct types, generation and shininess. Given that for each pokémon, I want multiple sprites (for shiny/not shiny and also for front/back sprites), it’s going to be easier, in the long run, to collect the target data for each pokémon in advance. Then access it as we download the sprites, rather than collecting the data each time.</p>
<h2 id="the-types">The Types</h2>
<p>While it may seem easier to collect the types for each pokémon one by one, this ends up being <strong>far</strong> slower than collecting all the pokémon of each type and <em>then</em> flipping it the other way since there are less than two dozen types and several hundred pokémon!</p>
<p>To acheive this, I keep getting the pokemon for each type until I get an error, then using the pokemon in the list for that type, I make a dictionary mapping pokemon to their types. The pseudocode for this is below:</p>
<div><pre class="hljs"><code>type_id = 0
type_index = dict() 
# will eventualy form a dictionary that looks like: 
# {poke1: [type11, type12], poke2: [type21, type22], ...}
<span class="hljs-type">WHILE</span> <span class="hljs-type">TRUE</span>:
    <span class="hljs-type">TRY</span>:
        <span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> = <span class="hljs-type">GET</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> name using pokebase
        pokemons = <span class="hljs-type">GET</span> all pokemon with that <span class="hljs-keyword">type</span>
    <span class="hljs-type">EXCEPT</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> doesn't exist:
        <span class="hljs-type">BREAK</span>
    type_id += 1
    
    <span class="hljs-type">FOR</span> pokemon <span class="hljs-type">IN</span> pokemons:
        old_types = type_index[pokemon] or [] if it dowsn't exist
        new_types = old_types + [<span class="hljs-keyword">type</span>]
        # new_types is now a list of the types that pokemon has so far
        type_index[pokemon] = new_types
    <span class="hljs-type">ENDFOR</span>
<span class="hljs-type">ENDWHILE</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For reasons I’ll explain when I talk about the model in the next part (link to be added) I also added a bit of code to add a second “none” type if the pokémon only has one type.</p>
<h2 id="the-generation">The Generation</h2>
<p>Getting the generation for each pokémon works much the same as the above portion of code for types. I also keep the same pokemon to generation mapping format as above to make adding everything together later more straightforward.</p>
<h2 id="the-shininess">The Shininess</h2>
<p>We don’t actually need to collect this in advance! Since <em>every</em> pokémon has a shiny and non-shiny version, we can construct this target bit of data on the fly as we download the sprites!</p>
<h2 id="the-sprites">The Sprites</h2>
<p>Now for the last thing: downloading the sprites! I intend just to download the sprites raw initially, and then I don’t need to re-download them if I do some extra preprocessing later. I use the same idea as the types and generations previously to keep downloading sprites until I run out. I also need to download different sprite versions (shiny/not shiny and front/back). To do this, I download every pokémon of one version, then all of the next and so on. The pseudocode for this is as follows:</p>
<div><pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">FOR</span> kwargs = {every combo of <span class="hljs-literal">True</span>/<span class="hljs-literal">False</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> <span class="hljs-string">"shiny"</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> <span class="hljs-string">"back"</span>}
    suffix = <span class="hljs-keyword">each</span> <span class="hljs-string">"True"</span> kwarg <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> an underscore between
    # eg {<span class="hljs-string">"shiny"</span>: <span class="hljs-literal">True</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"back"</span>: <span class="hljs-literal">True</span>} -&gt; <span class="hljs-string">"shiny_back"</span>
    # but {<span class="hljs-string">"shiny"</span>: <span class="hljs-literal">False</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"back"</span>: <span class="hljs-literal">True</span>} -&gt; <span class="hljs-string">"back"</span>
    
    index = <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">WHILE</span> <span class="hljs-literal">TRUE</span>:
        TRY:
            img_data = <span class="hljs-keyword">GET</span> sprite <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> ID index
        EXCEPT sprite doesn<span class="hljs-comment">'t exist:</span>
            BREAK
        index += <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
        
        filename = index + suffix + <span class="hljs-string">".jpg"</span>
        filepath = <span class="hljs-string">"./sprites/raw/"</span> + filename
        <span class="hljs-keyword">IF</span> filename doesn<span class="hljs-comment">'t exist:</span>
            WRITE img_data <span class="hljs-keyword">TO</span> filepath</code></pre></div>
<p>I also did a bit of preprocessing to standardise the images. Since the size of the images varied between 96x96 and 128x128 pixels, I rescaled everything down to 96x96. I also removed any transparency and gave the sprites a black background.</p>
<h2 id="connecting-it-all-together">Connecting It All Together</h2>
<p>With the sprites downloaded and preprocessed, and all the target data for each pokémon downloaded, I now needed a way to tie them together. I did this by taking a list of all the sprites, extracting the ID from the name, and getting the relevant types, generations, and shininess. This is done as follows:</p>
<div><pre class="hljs"><code>WITH open(<span class="hljs-string">"data.txt"</span>) AS <span class="hljs-built_in">file</span>:
    FOR image_name IN image_folder:
        <span class="hljs-built_in">id</span> = extract <span class="hljs-built_in">id</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> image_name
        <span class="hljs-comment"># shiny pokémon have the "shiny" in their name as per The Sprites</span>
        shininess = extract shininess <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> image_name
        types = type_index[<span class="hljs-built_in">id</span>][<span class="hljs-number">0</span>] + <span class="hljs-string">","</span> + type_index[<span class="hljs-built_in">id</span>][<span class="hljs-number">1</span>]
        gen = gen_index[<span class="hljs-built_in">id</span>]
        
        <span class="hljs-built_in">text</span> = image_name + <span class="hljs-string">","</span> + types + <span class="hljs-string">","</span> + gen + <span class="hljs-string">","</span> + shininess
        WRITE <span class="hljs-built_in">text</span> TO <span class="hljs-built_in">file</span></code></pre></div>
<h1 id="the-dataset">The Dataset</h1>
<p>The last thing in this post will be making a proper Dataset object from PyTorch. PyTorch uses Dataset objects to handle loading the data as training happens, they can be about as simple or complex as you need. Still, the minimum you need is a method to dispense the data and another to return how many data items there will be (so PyTorch knows not to request too many instances).</p>
<p>The first thing to do is make a way to get the data back out of the <code>data.txt</code> file we made previously. This isn’t hard to do, but more work will need to be done on the target data after this is sorted. Having a pokémon’s type be “fire” or “water” doesn’t mean much to a neural net since that only works with numbers. I, therefore, turned these categories into “one-hot vectors” (or two-hot in the type scenario).</p>
<p>A one-hot vector encodes each category to an index in a target vector. The corresponding element is then “hot” and marked with a 1, while the rest are zeroes. The model then tries to get the correct element as close to 1 and as close to 0 for the others.</p>
<div><pre class="hljs"><code>An Example One-Hot Encoding
D<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">og</span> -&gt;</span> [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>]
C<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">at</span> -&gt;</span> [<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>]
F<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">ish</span> -&gt;</span> [<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">1</span>]</code></pre></div>
<p>To parse the data file, I then convert the text file like so (to those that know the difference, the data is also converted to tensors as it gets parsed, if not, don’t worry about it, we’ll get more into PyTorch specifics later!):</p>
<div><pre class="hljs"><code>data_dict = dict()
<span class="hljs-symbol">FOR</span> line <span class="hljs-symbol">IN</span> text_file:
    splits = split lines along <span class="hljs-string">","</span>s
    index = splits[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>]
    
    types = <span class="hljs-symbol">EncodeOneHot</span>(splits[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>]) + <span class="hljs-symbol">EncodeOneHot</span>(splits[<span class="hljs-number">2</span>])
    # <span class="hljs-string">"fire,electric"</span> -&gt; [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,...] + [<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,...] = [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,...]  
    
    gen = <span class="hljs-symbol">EncodeOneHot</span>(splits[<span class="hljs-number">3</span>])
    # <span class="hljs-string">"gen-3"</span> -&gt; [<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,...]
    
    shiny = (splits[<span class="hljs-number">4</span>] == <span class="hljs-string">"true"</span>)
    # <span class="hljs-string">"false"</span> -&gt; <span class="hljs-number">0</span>
    
    data_dict[index] = [types, gen, shiny]</code></pre></div>
<p>In machine learning, it’s best to keep separate data sets for training and testing the model. Since the data is mixed together, I also needed to filter it as it gets loaded to keep separate sets. This is achieved with some python <a title="https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/python-dictionary-comprehension" href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/python-dictionary-comprehension">dictionary comprehension</a>.</p>
<div><pre class="hljs"><code>full_data = <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">full</span> data <span class="hljs-keyword">dictionary</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> data.txt
filtered_data = {key: full_data[key] <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">index</span>, key <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> enumerate(full_data) 
                 <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">index</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> index_mask <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> no_mask}</code></pre></div>
<p>This line may look a bit complicated… Essentially, all it does is take in a list of indexes to keep (e.g. [1,2,4,5,7,8,…]) and throws out any data element not in the index mask. Alternatively, if no_mask is True, all elements are added regardless of the index mask.</p>
<p>I plan to do several other fancy things with this Dataset later, but that is all that’s needed for now!</p>
<p>Here’s a chunk of pseudocode for the Dataset (with lots of little things skimmed over that I’ll come back to later)</p>
<div><pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">MultimonDataset</span>(<span class="hljs-title class_ inherited__">Dataset</span>):
    self __init__(self, data_file, img_path, index_mask, no_mask = <span class="hljs-literal">False</span>)
        full_data = self.parse_data_file(data_file)
        self.data = {key: full_data[key] <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> index, key <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">enumerate</span>(full_data) 
                     <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> index <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> index_mask <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> no_mask}
        <span class="hljs-comment"># filter data as before</span>
        
        self.img_path = img_path
    
    self __len__(self)
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">len</span>(self.data)
    
    self __getitem__(self, index):
        key = self.data.keys()[index]
        img = READ (self.img_path + key)
        labels = self.data[key]

    self parse_data_file(self, filename):
        <span class="hljs-comment"># Parse data as described above</span></code></pre></div>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>Congrats! With that, we’ve come to the end of Part 1 of the project! I set out the rough outline of the project and got a lot of the data management sorted! Next up, I’ll very quickly skim over some machine learning basics and start making the model!</p>
